Welcome to my **Machine Learning Practice Tutorials**

This repository contains hands-on tutorials that I am working on to explore various Machine Learning Algorithms. 
The goal is to explore various machine learning algorithms and compare prediction score on same dataset with different algorithms to get the most optimal score.

- Step-by-step **Jupyter Notebooks** covering different ML concepts.
- Some Data Cleaning and Precrossing 
- **Code implementations** of common ML algorithms.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and visualization techniques.
- Notes and explanations to reinforce key ML topics.



Topics Covered

✅ Supervised Learning (Regression & Classification) 

✅ Unsupervised Learning (Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction)
